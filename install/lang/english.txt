Welcome to the installer for ImDisk Toolkit.
This will install the ImDisk Toolkit (build %S).
Installation folder:
 Components 
ImDisk Virtual Disk Driver (required)
DiscUtils library (uses .NET Framework 4)
RamDisk Configuration Tool
 Options 
Enable entries in context menus
Create shortcuts on desktop
Load ImDskSvc automatically
Language:
Please keep your mouse over an item to get details.
Install driver. This includes a Control Panel applet, a command line tool, imdisk.exe, and interfaces to manage volumes from Explorer context menus.##Please type "imdisk" in a command prompt for details.
Required to mount advanced image file formats like VHD, VDI, VMDK and some others.##Also adds a command line tool in the installation folder, DiscUtilsDevio.exe, and a dedicated dialog box to use the library from file context menu in Explorer.
This tool will allow you to easily configure one or several RamDisks with various settings.
Add entries in the drive context menu and the file context menu to manage ImDisk volumes and image files directly from Explorer.##This option can be set later in the Windows Start Menu.
Create shortcuts on desktop.##All shortcuts are always created in the Windows Start Menu.
Start ImDskSvc automatically at system startup.##No tool in this package uses this service, so you can safely uncheck this option.##It is installed by the driver to initiate TCP/IP or serial port connections with proxy softwares.

Instead of allocating the whole size, memory is#allocated only when it is actually used.#This is slower but can save a lot of memory if#you are using only a small part of the ramdisk.
Unmount the selected ImDisk drive and unregister it.
Default: NTFS.##*FAT* file systems are usually faster but with less features.#FAT and FAT32 also have limitations in the maximal volume size.
Once created, register the ramdisk to be started with Windows.#Several ramdisks can be registered.
Create a Temp folder at the root of the volume.##To create other folders, define what you want in a#folder of your hard drive, and specify it in the Data tab.

Bigger clusters are usually faster but can use more#disk space, especially with a large number of files.
Label size is limited by the file system:#32 characters with NTFS, 11 with *FAT*.
Default: disabled.##Do a quick format. It can speed up the RamDisk building but the allocated#memory does not immediately appear as used in the Windows Task Manager.
Default: disabled.##Allows files to be compressed before being written to the ramdisk.#Only works with the NTFS file system.#Do not use it if you care about speed!##Not recommended with dynamic ramdisks, because memory#may not be released properly.
Default: disabled.##Allocate memory through AWE.#This guarantees that the memory is never written to the pagefile.##On 32-bit systems, this also bypasses the 2GB and 4GB limits per#process and allows to allocate as much memory as the system#manages (but not the unmanaged or invisible memory).
Default: disabled.##Use a folder instead of a drive letter to mount the ramdisk.
Unmount selected ImDisk mount point and unregister it.
The mount point must be an empty directory located on a NTFS volume.#Up to 10 mount points can be registered to be mounted at Windows startup.
You can add here any parameter that is not already used by the GUI.#For example, "-o rem" will add removable attribute to the drive.#Click on the "..." button to list all parameters.

Data
Load Content from Image File or Folder:
Synchronize at System Shutdown
Copy only files with Archive attribute
Delete data removed from the RamDisk
Excluded Folders:
Synchronize now
If you select a folder, its entire content will be copied once the ramdisk#created, with file attributes and ACL, depending on the file system.##An image file must be raw, without partition, and with a valid file system.#Such image can be created for instance with a right click on a drive letter#in Explorer: "Save disk contents as image file".
Default: disabled.##Copy data from the ramdisk to the folder or image file at#system shutdown, depending on the parameters below.
One folder per line.#Folders are relative to the root of the ramdisk#(drive letter or mount point): do not add it.
Synchronize all the registered ramdisks now.

Using AWE with dynamic ramdisks requires the privilege to lock pages in memory in the local group policy.#If you choose to continue, this privilege will be granted for the Administrators group.##Do you want to continue?
Privilege granted successfully.#A logout is required for this change to take effect.#Logout now?
Error: cannot grant the privilege.

"Automatic" uses TRIM commands when available. They are much#more efficient but they require NTFS and Windows 7 or later.##Otherwise, when required, depending on the 3 parameters below, a#cleanup function wipes the whole empty space with a temporary file#filled with 0 (because data blocks filled with 0 are automatically freed).
Default: 20.##Number of bytes per allocated memory block, in power of 2.#The minimal value is 12 (4 KB). Use 13 for 8 KB, 14 for 16 KB,#and so on, up to 30 (1 GB).##A lower value can reduce the memory use and improve#efficiency of the cleanup function in case of highly#fragmented files, but it also reduces the performances.
Default: 10.##The cleanup function runs only if this amount of memory can#be freed. The value is a ratio of the total drive space (e.g.:#10/1000 of a 4 GB drive = 40 MB). This is only an estimate: the#memory amount actually freed can be slightly higher or lower.
Default: 10.##A low value can make the cleanup more responsive but may be inappropriate#in case where files are regularly deleted without being recreated.
Default: 10.##Wait until reads and writes are below this value before processing the cleanup.

Warning: the fast startup feature of Windows is enabled. This can lead to some issues:##● The system writes the ramdisk content onto the hard drive at shutdown, and restores it at startup.#● The data synchronization feature of ImDisk Toolkit does not work at system shutdown.##Open the Shutdown settings to disable the fast startup.
